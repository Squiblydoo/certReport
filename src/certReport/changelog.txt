Changelog
2.0.2
-   Fixed bugs in regards to checking if attributes of the API results exist.
    - Specifically, checking for values like popular threat labels, popular threat names, popular threat categories, crowdsourced IDS rules, were not done appropriately.
-   Fixed bug where report relied on the x509 attribute, which was the wrong attribute to rely on.
-   Improvements:
    -   Made it possible to print a report without a certificate being attached to the file.
